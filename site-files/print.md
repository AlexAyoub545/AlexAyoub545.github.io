Okay considering your here reading this you've probably finished arithmetics. If you haven't, you know, skipped it or anything.. If you did go back to it it's a very important lesson. So this lesson will teach you about the function called `print()`.

Don't start thinking "Oh print, like printing papers from a document or a pdf I know this I can skip this" No it's not printing a paper it's making your code print a specific text into your console/app. *Note: Console means terminal I'll be using that word a lot more in the intro rather than using terminal*
