When robotics first started, Python was used mainly to understand how programming worked. It was presumably chosen because it was easy to use, and its role was a stepping stone for NXC programming with Mindstorms NXTs. However, with the Mindstorms EV3s, Python is no longer a stepping stone, but the language used. In addition, Python 2, which was the language previously taught, was deprecated as of 2020.

This Python 3 tutorial will focus on the basics of Python programming, with more focus on how to use the EV3DEV library later on.
